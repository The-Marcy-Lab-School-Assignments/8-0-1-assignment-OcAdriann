# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer

"Static assets" are files that are delivered to the client and will always remain the same as how they are stored on the server. We provide static assets to a react project using the `express.static()` function.

```js
const path = require("path");

const pathToDistFolder = path.join(__dirname, "../../path/to/frontend/dist");

//Creates the Middleware function to serve static assets
const serveStatic = express.static(pathToDistFolder);

//uses the function to serve static assets
app.use(serveStatic);
```

# Teacher Feedback

Yes, static assets will not change and yes we can use express.static() to show static assets but how do we generate static assets?
